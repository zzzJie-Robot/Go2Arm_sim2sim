üöÄ Welcome to the **Go2Arm_sim2sim** platform! This project aims to provide an efficient and convenient simulation environment for verifying reinforcement learning algorithms for **legged manipulators**, assisting your research and development efforts.

[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](https://github.com/zzzJie-Robot/Go2Arm_sim2sim/blob/main/README_CN.md "‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£")

üí° sim2sim represents the migration from the IsaacLab platform to the Gazebo platform. The deployment on physical platforms (sim2real) will be introduced in future versions.

- **Base platform**: Unitree Go2 quadruped
- **Manipulator**: Interbotix WidowX 250s robotic arm

>**üíª System Requirements**  
>This project is built on `ros-noetic` and is recommended to be run on the `Ubuntu20.04` operating system.

>**üì¢ IsaacLab Simulation**  
>If you would like to conduct reinforcement learning training for legged robotic manipulators in IsaacLab, please visit:

# Quick Start Guide üì¶
## Step 1: Get the Code Repository
Clone the project code to your local machine by running the following command in the terminal:  
```
git clone https://github.com/zzzJie-Robot/Go2Arm_sim2sim.git
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
**ROS Dependency Installation**

Ensure that the following ROS dependencies are installed on your system. You can install them all at once with the following command:
```
sudo apt install ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-noetic-controller-interface ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control ros-noetic-joint-state-controller ros-noetic-effort-controllers ros-noetic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-controller-manager
```
**libtorch Library Deployment**

1.Choose a suitable directory (e.g., your workspace) and navigate to it:
```
cd <YOUR_DESIRED_PATH>
```
2.Download the libtorch library:Ôºö
```
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1%2Bcpu.zip
```
3.Unzip the file and set the environment variable:
```
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cpu.zip -d ./
echo 'export Torch_DIR=<YOUR_DESIRED_PATH>/libtorch' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Step 3: Compile the Project
Navigate to the project root directory and run the compilation command:

```
cd /path/to/Go2Arm_sim2sim
catkin_make
```

## Step 4: Run the Example Program
Open three terminals and execute the following commands in sequence:

**Terminal 1: Environment Initialization**
```
cd /path/to/Go2Arm_sim2sim
source ./devel/setup.bash
roslaunch go2arm_gazebo go2arm.launch
```
**Terminal 2: Load the Reinforcement Learning Model**
```
cd /path/to/Go2Arm_sim2sim
source ./devel/setup.bash
rosrun go2arm_gazebo main
```
**Terminal 3: Start Keyboard Control**
```
cd /path/to/Go2Arm_sim2sim
source ./devel/setup.bash
rosrun go2arm_gazebo keyboard_control
```

## Keyboard Control for Your Robot

| Keyboard | Robot Dog Movement       | Keyboard | Gripper Movement       | Keyboard | Gripper Pose                     | Keyboard | Gripper Action   |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| w        | Robot dog moves forward  | i        | Gripper moves forward  | 7        | Gripper rolls clockwise          | 1        | Gripper grips    |
| s        | Robot dog moves backward | k        | Gripper moves backward | 4        | Gripper rolls counterclockwise   | 2        | Gripper releases |
| a        | Robot dog moves left     | j        | Gripper moves left     | 8        | Gripper pitches clockwise        |          |                  |
| d        | Robot dog moves right    | l        | Gripper moves right    | 5        | Gripper pitches counterclockwise |          |                  |
| q        | Robot dog turns left     | u        | Gripper moves up       | 9        | Gripper yaws clockwise           |          |                  |
| e        | Robot dog turns right    | o        | Gripper moves down     | 6        | Gripper yaws counterclockwise    |          |                  |



## Add Your RL Model
To use your custom reinforcement learning model, simply rename your `.pt` model file to `policy.pt` and replace the existing file with the same name in the project. The path is as follows:
```
cd /path/to/Go2Arm_sim2sim/model
```

>Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è  
>Please ensure that the order of the actions output by your model is consistent with the order in this project, and also match the PD parameters of the motors.
